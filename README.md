Style Guide
 - For methods and functions, etc. put a space followed by the opening bracket on the same line
 - For methods and functions, etc. closing brackets will be on a separate line after code
 - For single line if/else statements, use brackets
 - Use tabs not spaces
 - Camel case variable names, starting with lowercase
 - No whitespace at the end of lines, etc.
 - No blank lines unless separating different functions or clearly delineating code as separate
 - Unary special-character operators (e.g., !, ++) must not have space next to their operand
 - Any , and ; must not have preceding space
 - Any ; used as a statement terminator must be at the end of the line
 - Any : after a property name in an object definition must not have preceding space
 - No filler spaces in empty constructs (e.g., {}, [])
 - For empty strings, use "" rather than String.empty
 - Comments are always preceded by a blank line
 - For multi-line comments, /* is used rather than //
